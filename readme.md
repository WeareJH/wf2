# wf2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WeareJH/wf2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WeareJH/wf2)


## Install
`wf2` is distributed as a single binary with everything packaged inside -
this means you *do not* need PHP or Composer installed on your machine.

### Manual
1. Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/WeareJH/wf2/releases)
2. Make the file executable: (assuming you keep it in the `Downloads` folder)

    `chmod +x ~/Downloads/wf2`
3. Now either add an alias to your `~/.zshrc` (or bash profile)

    `echo 'alias wf2="~/Downloads/wf2"' >> ~/.zshrc`

   or, move the program to somewhere in your existing path - see instructions below if you wish to do this:

<details><summary>Instructions for adding to your path</summary>

1. Move the executable from your Downloads folder to /opt

    `sudo mv ~/Downloads/wf2 /opt`

2. **Replace** the alias you made previously in your *zshrc* or *bash_profile* with:

    `export PATH="$PATH:/opt"`

3. Use the following command to refresh any already open terminals

    `source ~/.zshrc`

4. Or for bash users

    `source ~/.bash_profile`

5. Type the following command to check all is installed OK:

    `wf2`

6. You should see the same output as below (in features):
